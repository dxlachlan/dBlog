This is my first Video Blog for my Gilman Scholarship. I'll be updating this site with random content as apart of my Gilman Scholarship follow-on project. Once a week I'll be uploading a 2 to 5 minute video of highlighting stuff I've done or experienced while abroad. This one is just random clips from my travels from Charlotte to New York, to Hong Kong, to Tokyo.
