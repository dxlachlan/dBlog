<p>So the last two weeks have been a bit of an adjustment. I'm still working on getting completely adjusted to life in Japan, which I've gotten a grasp on for the most. I however, have now started classes, and have had to get adjusted to a bit more of a difficult setting in regards to my language classes. All of my instruction has been in upper-intermediate level Japanese only, which has lead to a couple mishaps.</p>

<p>While I've still been working on making friends at school, I've also been going out alot on my own in getting familiar with Tokyo and the surrounding areas. I've also made it a point to hang out with my friend Shoya on a regular basis. I met him while he was training at my Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gym in America and became pretty solid friends. Since I provided him a bit of hospitality in America, he's been returning the favor in various ways. Showing me some of the areas around his neighborhood, taking me to his home BJJ gym, and taking me to his friends Restaurant Robin69. His friends at Robin69 treated me well and played some awesome American oldies and soul tunes.</p>

The last two weeks have been extremely busy which is why I'm so behind on getting this text update and my last video blog update up. I had normally been doing just locational/linear type video blogs of places I've visited or experiences from my daily routine here in Japan. I have a few planned updates coming up, so hopefully I can get caught up to get things squared away and some more interesting content up. There's been alot of cultural stuff going on. A few I wish I had my video camera for but even though I didn't I still managed to get a few phone videos and pictures that I'll hopefully get updated soon.

<p>Aside from my core Japanese language class, I'm taking a few culture classes. A Japanese Photography Course (which I still need to get a camera for), A Japanese cultural exchanges course, and a Japanese folklore class. Between my culture classes there will be a few excursions out in which I'll be able to get a bit of content for this, including a trip to Mt. Fuji/Aokigahara, as well as a upcoming camping trip with some of the other international students.</p>
