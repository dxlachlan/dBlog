<p>I took a short day trip to Enoshima to catch a fireworks show. I went solo and wanted to run through and shoot video of Enoshima. I, however, took the wrong train twice and ended up arriving late so I didn't have much time to shoot much video. It got dark pretty early and my Camera doesn't shoot well in the dark. Either way, here you go.</p>
