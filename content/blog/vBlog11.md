<p>Things have been getting pretty hectic with school and such so I decided to break my trip to Mount Fuji into two parts to upload. This trip was for my Japanese Folktales Class. We started at PFC Campus early in the morning before heading to Yamanashi Prefecture where we visited the Sengen Shrine, ate Houtou (Yamanashi Native Food) which is similar to a Japanese version of Chicken and Dumplings, visited the 5th Station of Mt. Fuji, an Ice Cave near Aokigahar, and Aokigahara Forest itself.</p>
