<p>So I've been a bit behind on everything for my Gilman Project because School has started and I've been trying to focus on adjusting to my new school schedule. Last Sunday I also had Omikoshi. I'll be posting a text update soon with pictures and videos from the Machida Festival and Omikoshi, along with other things I did between now and then.</p>
